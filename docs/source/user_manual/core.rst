Vittles provides several models in the **Core** app for working with the basic
elements of creating recipes. These include:

    Foods
        Edible stuff that you cook with
    Categories
        Used for grouping foods
    Units
        Ways of measuring food by volume, weight, or discrete quantities,
        such as cups, liters, ounces or grams
    Equivalences
        Conversions between units
    Preparations
        Ways of preparing food such as chopping, slicing, or mashing

The initial database load populates these tables with some basic starter data,
but you may find that you need to add more as you create new recipes.
